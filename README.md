# demo-project

a demo project for learning how to structure python project

At minimum, you'll need to create the following:


- README.md: A description of your project and its goals.
- LICENSE.md: Your project's license, if it's open source. (See opensource.org for more information about selecting one.)
- .gitignore: A special file that tells Git what files and directories to ignore. (If you're using another VCS, this file has a different name. Look it up.)
- A directory with the name of your project.
